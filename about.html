					<p>We are volunteer-based charity, non-government animal sanctuary and organization based in Quezon City, Metro Manila that is not funded by the government, a non-profit NGO (non-goverment organization) without arresting or owned pet seizing powers. We are a multitasking skeletal office staff, 75 doctors (who attends to the shelter animals as well as the patients of the low-cost clinic for consultations and spay/neuter), 300+ animals with 90 nurses, 2 service vehicle which relies on funds from donations and fundraisers, and the availability of unpaid volunteers (ordinary citizens just like you who have jobs or attend school and just donate their time when able).</p>
					<p>All animals in shelters get a full check-ups so you’ll know exactly what’s up with your new furry friend. No heartbreaking hidden diseases, such as parvovirus, which often affects animals from puppy mills. It’s also a common practice for us to spay or neuter some animals as part of the adoption process. So you’re not just saving one animal—you’re saving the hundreds of animals one unfixed cat or dog can produce in his or her lifetime. We at Little One's Sanctuary want both our friends and their owners full happiness and companionship. Therefore, our workers and volunteers at animal shelters know the animals well that they help you find your perfect match. They know each animal’s history, what games are his or her favorite to play, and what cuddles he or she likes best. We can even offer you and your companion classes to get to know each other! </p>
