				<h3>Finn and Azl</h3>
	    		<p> Rescuers found Finn as a pup. He was dragging his two legs behind him and he was a pitiful sight to behold. X-rays revealed that an impact - probably from a car - had caused Finn to lose the use of his hind legs. The pup could still poop and pee normally but serious discussions had immediately begun in the clinic. The main concern was - if he was in any pain - and if he could have a good life even with his disability.
	    		<br><br> A volunteer who was trying to be optimistic in the midst of all the sad and serious faces brought out a doggie toy and called out to Finn. The puppy 'leaped' into a frenzy, going into an enthusiastic 'play' mode, running after the offered toy and shaking the toy vigorously once he caught it with his jaws.</p>

				<h3>August and Nathalie</h3>
		      	<p>August was in a puppy mill and the volunteers was able to rescue, an extremely lucky one. He seemed to have won the lottery of all lotteries when - on top of being one of the 50 dogs left alive from the total of 200 dogs crammed in a truck en route to Baguio, he was one of the eight (8) picked out by James when the organization offered to take in only an original 7 rescuees  to be transferred to the sanctuary from their temporary holding area in Manila City until they are able to be adopted.<br><br>
	    		Now he is in a loving home and currently plays with his new owners and new sister Phoebe and playmate Panda.

				<h3>Phoebe and Farah</h3>
		      	<p>Phoebe was rescued by a volunteer on February 14, 2017, at the back of a University in Manila. At first glance, it was the usual case of neglect; she was skin and bones, trembling with fear, eyes sunken.<br><br>
		      	But despite her painful condition, she remained good-natured and affectionate. She instantly became a favorite among the volunteers, even through her leg needed a surgery for her left front leg, which was broken. It took almost 4 months for her to recuperate from this horrific mishap, but Valentine,‚Äù as the volunteers and staff fondly called her, was all smiles and tail wags and warm licks.<br><br>
		      	Now fully recovered, Phoebe now hops happily in his forever home with the wonderful family, along with their previous adoptee August, another companion. </p>

				<img src="assets/images/1.jpg" class="story-pic1"> <h3>Dember and Nicole</h3>
		      	<p>Dember was shaking in fright and cold when the volunteers rescued her from the floods last on October of 2016. As if that weren't enough, she was soon diagnosed with CTVT, a highly contagious and painful disease. 
		      	<br><br>It was because of this that adoption counselors advised Nicole and her family to choose a different dog instead of Dember. But to everyone's surprise and joy, Dember's adopters patiently waited and cared for her during the entire treatment and recovery, which took months.</p>

		      	<p>Roxy was separated from her mother at a dangerously young age. Exposed to the elements,she developed a respiratory illness at only one week old. Our founder took her in, bottle-fed her, medicated and gave her lots of TLC. Kittens as weak as she was only had 30 percent or so chances of surviving, but Roxy pulled through with her strong will to live. <br><br>
		      	Now, eight months after being rescued, Roxy lounges quietly and happily with her companions. But she knows, as much as every volunteer does, that a home is what she really needs-a family that would never abandon or leave her to fend for herself in the cruel outside world. She's still waiting, hoping</p>
