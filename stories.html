			<p>Every  year, our Sanctuary cares for over 500 dogs and cats rescued from cruelty or neglect. The cost of rescuing, treating and rehabilitating animals will be too much for a small struggling shelter if not for the help of supporters and donors. You can help our shelter animals by choosing to make a monthly or quarterly contribution by sending us personaly or <a href="contact.html">contacting</a> us. Your donations, whether in cash or in-kind, go a long way towards helping the group perform its mandate of fighting for the welfare and humane treatment of animals.</p>

						<h1>Finn and Azl</h1>
	    				<p class="card-text"> Rescuers found Finn as a pup. He was dragging his two legs behind him and he was a pitiful sight to behold. X-rays revealed that an impact - probably from a car - had caused Finn to lose the use of his hind legs. The pup could still poop and pee normally but serious discussions had immediately begun in the clinic. The main concern was - if he was in any pain - and if he could have a good life even with his disability.

	    				<br> A volunteer who was trying to be optimistic in the midst of all the sad and serious faces brought out a doggie toy and called out to Finn.

	    				<br>The puppy 'leaped' into a frenzy, going into an enthusiastic 'play' mode, running after the offered toy and shaking the toy vigorously once he caught it with his jaws.</p>
